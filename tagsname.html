    <h1>b tag</h1>
    <p> b tag or bold tag is used to make the text appear <b>bold on a webpage. HTML
            provides us a set of tags/elements that are used</b>
        for the text formatting or in simple words, we can provide some basic styling to the
        text by applying some formatting
        features like bold, italics, etc.</p>
    <h1>i tag</h1>
    <p> i is use To display a part of the text in the <i>italic form on the browser,
            the HTML tag</i>
        is used. This tag, however, does not
        add any logical meaning to the content within it. The HTML tag is thus used to serve
        this purpose. Both thetags, however, have the same visual effects.</p>
      <h1>u tag</h1>
       <p>The HTML tag defines text that should be styled differently or have a non-textual annotation. Browsers
            traditionally
            render the text found within the <u> tag as underlined text. This tag is also commonly referred to as the
            </u>
                    element.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>select tag</h1>
                    <p>The element is most often used in a form, to collect user input.
                        The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted
                        (if you omit the name attribute,
                        no data from the drop-down list will be submitted).
                        The id attribute is needed to associate the drop-down list with a label.</p>
